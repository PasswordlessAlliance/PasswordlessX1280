# PasswordlessAlliance Q&A

The Passwordless Alliance aims to advance the passwordless world by providing free passwordless software to B2C online services worldwide.

Passwordless X1280 software, provided by the Passwordless Alliance, is a technology defined as X.1280 by ITU-T, the International Technology Standardization Organization under the United Nations. It allows online services to present an automatic password to the user, and the user confirms it with their smartphone, instead of the user entering the password and online services confirming it.

We want to create a password-free, secure, and convenient digitized world by letting online services take over the responsibility of proving passwords instead of users memorizing and changing them. Join us in creating a passwordless world!

In this repository you can share information about Passwordless X1280 and discuss your queries.
